I intend to add links to projects, and occasionally blog. Enjoy! \r\n\r\n### Neighborhood App\r\nThis application was created completely from scratch. The idea comes from a prompt at the end of an Udacity course I took linked here:\r\n[Intro to Javascript Design Patterns](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud989/l-3417188540/m-3374098584)\r\n\r\nYou can find the live application here:\r\n[Neighborhood App](http://aruballo.github.io/neighborhoodapp/)\r\n\r\nIt is a simple app that lets you search for \"Interesting\" locations near you, using Yelp APIs, like restaurants, barbershops, gas stations, etc. You can find my github repo here:\r\n<https://github.com/aruballo/neighborhoodapp>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
